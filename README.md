# POC React with Flavors

## Summary

This is a proof of concept of a React App with generic components and variable/injectable data.

## How to use

- Add a new string property in the `IFlavor` interface.
- Add the new string to every flavor.
- Use `import { strings, assets } from "@data";` to get the strings references

TODO:

- Include only strings and assets from the flavor the React app is built for
